# Comment about method of solution: In order to find out how many people rode the taxi in June, we need to add up all of the values in the fourth column (passenger count)
cat /class/datamine/data/taxi/yellow/yellow_tripdata_2019-06.csv | awk -F, '{mysum = mysum + $4} END{print mysum}'
# Output from the solution: 10878820

# 1b. (2 pt)
# Comment about method of solution: For this solution we take the number of passengers and divide it by the number of rides
cat /class/datamine/data/taxi/yellow/yellow_tripdata_2019-06.csv | awk -F, '{mytotal = mytotal + $4; myrides = myrides + 1} END{print mytotal / myrides}'
# Output from the solution: 1.56732

# Comment about method of solution: In order to find how much was spent on a certain date, we need to use an if function and add up everything from the 5th column.
cat /class/datamine/data/8451/The_Complete_Journey_2_Master/5000_transactions.csv | awk -F, '{if($3 == "23-DEC-17") {mysum = mysum + $5}} END{print mysum}'
# Output from the solution: 108408

# Comment about method of solution: To find the average amount spent on December 23rd we take the total amount spent on December 23rd and divide it by the number of transactions
cat /class/datamine/data/8451/The_Complete_Journey_2_Master/5000_transactions.csv | awk -F, '{if($3 == "23-DEC-17") {mytotal = mytotal + $5; mytransaction = mytransaction + 1}} END{print mytotal / mytransaction}'
# Output from the solution: 4.07045

# 3a. (2 pt)
# Comment about method of solution: To find the solution we need to add up all the values in column 15 and use the delimiter on \ and |
cat /class/datamine/data/election/itcont2020.txt | awk -F\| '{mysum = mysum + $15} END{print mysum}'
#Output from the solution: 893005024
